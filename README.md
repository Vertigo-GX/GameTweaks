# Game Tweaks
A small server-side/singleplayer Minecraft mod for Fabric that allows tweaking of a few features that don't have game rules.

(Note: Has only been tested in singeplayer so far!)

### Features:
* Disables lightning starting a fire where it strikes. Mobs that are hit will still catch on fire.
* Disables nether-portal blocks occasionally spawning zombified piglins.
* Disables endermen being able to pick up blocks.
* All features are optional.

### Configuration:
Either edit the config file (`game-tweaks.ini`) found in the Fabric config folder, or use [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) to edit the options in game.

### Recommendations:
